# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
One and Two Layer Neural Networks

This repository contains the implementations of one and two layer neural networks and the mnist dataset. Sigmoid, MSE, Xavier, Scale, and accuracy functions are also added. It runs on 20 epochs with a batch size of 100. The NN runs on scaled Fashion Mnist dataset, since the dataset is too big, I left a link to the unscaled dataset.
